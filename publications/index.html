Older adults with this condition often face challenges in everyday kitchen tasks, such as forgetting where they had previously placed food items. Hence, this research aims to develop an accurate, real-time and scalable system that tracks food items in a kitchen, and uses this data to help older adults with MCI search for their desired items. To build this system, live video streams from three Azure Kinect cameras were accessed to obtain real-time 3D information about the kitchen space. Next, potential food items in the frame were identified using zero-shot object detection models. Thereafter, the locations of these items would be determined based on the current detection data, human wrist data obtained from OpenPose and cabinet data obtained from the depth frame, and updated in a database. By accessing the database, the system would thus be able to help older adults search for their desired items. Therefore, this system can alleviate common challenges faced by older adults with MCI in the kitchen, giving them greater autonomy over their lives.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NCUR</abbr> </div> <div id="NCUR" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">AI vs Human Creativity: Investigating the Effectiveness of AI-Generated Advertisements</div> <div class="author"> Calvin Chan and <em>Glenda Tan</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>National Conference of Undergraduate Research</em>, Pittsburgh USA, Apr 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="award btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Award</a> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="award hidden d-print-inline"> <p></p> <p><b>CMU Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholar Development Presentation Award 2025</b></p> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>With rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), many companies have begun incorporating generative AI into their advertising strategies, producing unique and engaging commercials that transcend the limits of traditional advertising. Given the immense success of these campaigns, this research aims to investigate if AI-generated ads can outperform their human-made counterparts in increasing consumer demand, and if so, the factors contributing to their greater success. To answer these questions, we first conducted two case analyses on Nike’s “Never Done Evolving” ft. Serena Williams campaign and Coca-Cola’s “Y3000” campaign. Next, we devised a theoretical framework of three potential success factors for AI-generated ads (complexity, creativity, and familiarity). Finally, a week-long field study was conducted on 240 Carnegie Mellon University students across different years and majors to study the effectiveness of AI-generated ads in increasing club membership of campus organizations, with club membership serving as a proxy for consumer demand. In this study, participants were randomly partitioned into four groups, with each group surveyed on how likely they were to join a club after viewing one of four posters (three AI-generated posters based on each factor of success and one human-made poster). Through this study, we discovered that although AI-generated posters are generally more effective than human-made posters in capturing people’s attention, their human-made counterparts are still more effective in increasing club membership. While AI-generated posters attract a larger audience, there is greater variation in the interest level of the audience. Future research can further explore the impact of AI advertisements on various aspects of marketing, such as click-thru rates and sales on different marketing platforms such as e-commerce.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">IEEE ICMI</abbr> </div> <div id="IEEE" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Stool Recognition for Colorectal Cancer Detection through Deep Learning</div> <div class="author"> <em>Glenda Tan</em>, Karin Goh, and Bingquan Shen </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing and Machine Intelligence</em>, Michigan USA, Apr 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="award btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Awards</a> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17288" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="award hidden d-print-inline"> <p></p> <p><b>Gold Award</b>, Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2021</p> <p><b>Singapore University of Technology and Design Research &amp; Innovation Award: Healthcare</b></p> <p><b>Grand Prize Bronze Award</b>, Global Youth Science and Technology Bowl 2021 Hong Kong</p> <p><b>Represented Singapore</b> at Global Youth Science and Technology Bowl 2021 Hong Kong</p> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in Singapore and the third most common cancer worldwide. Blood in a person’s stool is a symptom of this disease, and it is usually detected by the faecal occult blood test (FOBT). However, the FOBT presents several limitations - the collection process for the stool samples is tedious and unpleasant, the waiting period for results is about 2 weeks and costs are involved. In this research, we propose a simple-to-use, fast and cost-free alternative - a stool recognition neural network that determines if there is blood in one’s stool (which indicates a possible risk of colorectal cancer) from an image of it. As this is a new classification task, there was limited data available, hindering classifier performance. Hence, various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (DiffAugment StyleGAN2, DCGAN, Conditional GAN) were trained to generate images of high fidelity to supplement the dataset. Subsequently, images generated by the GAN with the most realistic images (DiffAugment StyleGAN2) were concatenated to the classifier’s training batch on-the-fly, improving accuracy to 94%. This model was then deployed to a mobile app - Poolice, where users can take a photo of their stool and obtain instantaneous results if there is blood in their stool, prompting those who do to seek medical advice. As "early detection saves lives", we hope our app built on our stool recognition neural network can help people detect colorectal cancer earlier, so they can seek treatment and have higher chances of survival.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">WOVEN</abbr> </div> <div id="WOVEN" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Art Restoration</div> <div class="author"> <em>Glenda Tan</em> and Chad Szalkowski-Ference </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>WOVEN: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Dietrich College</em>, Apr 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/gened/woven/issues/four/docs/piece-3-glenda-min.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Art restoration, the practice of returning a damaged artwork to its original condition, is challenging: each artwork requires a unique treatment and complex ethical boundaries may be crossed. However, this field can be transformed by today’s artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which currently excel in artistic tasks. Hence, this research aims to elucidate the role of AI in art restoration, specifically in restoring damaged paintings. To achieve this, an AI image enhancer web application was tested on images of three damaged paintings, with its digital reconstructions benchmarked against the actual restorations using various technical and aesthetic metrics. Results show that AI currently plays the role of an assistant in the analysis stage of art restoration: while AI can propose feasible intervention methods and produce digital reconstructions to aid art restorers in restoration (accelerating, improving accuracy and lowering costs), it cannot guide them in navigating complex ethical boundaries. Art restorers are still responsible for striking the balance between improving an artwork’s legibility and respecting the original creation. These findings showcase the potential of AI to the artistic and historical communities, spurring further research into developing more effective AI algorithms.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">BioHackrXiv</abbr> </div> <div id="BioHackrXiv" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The fourth annual Carnegie Mellon Libraries hackathon for biomedical data management, knowledge graphs, and deep learning</div> <div class="author"> Jedrzej Kubica, Rachit Kumar, <em>Glenda Tan</em>, Van Q.

The event was jointly hosted by Carnegie Mellon University Libraries and DNAnexus, a California-based cloud computing and bioinformatics company. This collaborative effort revolved around the theme of “Data Management and Graph Extraction for Large Transformer Models in the Biomedical Space.” In the spirit of fostering collaboration, participants organized themselves into five teams, which ultimately resulted in the successful completion of four hackathon projects. These projects encompassed a wide range of topics, from detecting features contributing to virus susceptibility to validating models using knowledge graphs. Repositories for the hackathon projects are available at https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics. We hope that the insights and experiences shared by these teams, as detailed in the following manuscript, will prove valuable to the broader scientific community.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">IJAIA</abbr> </div> <div id="IJAIA" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Predicting More Infectious Virus Variants for Pandemic Prevention through Deep Learning</div> <div class="author"> <em>Glenda Tan</em>, Tze Erhn Koay, and Bingquan Shen </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>International Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Applications</em>, Jul 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="award btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Awards</a> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14854" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">arXiv</a> <a href="https://aircconline.com/ijaia/V13N4/13422ijaia03.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="award hidden d-print-inline"> <p></p> <p><b>Gold Award</b>, Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2022</p> <p><b>Represented Singapore</b> at Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair 2022 Atlanta USA</p> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>More infectious virus variants can arise from rapid mutations in their proteins, creating new infection waves.
