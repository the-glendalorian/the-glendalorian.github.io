I presented my research, <a href="https://the-glendalorian.github.io/publications/">"Vision and Tracking in a Smart AI Kitchen for Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment"</a>, at the CMU Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium 2025 together with my teammates Jessica Han, Ryan Ding and Pranavi Kondapalli. A big thank you to our research advisors Prof. Reid Simmons, Prof. Zackory Erickson and Dr. Pragathi Praveena for their guidance in this research!
