I was awarded the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship 2025 for my research, <a href="https://the-glendalorian.github.io/publications/">"Vision and Tracking in a Smart AI Kitchen for Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment"</a>. I'm very grateful to all my research mentors for their encouragement and support!
