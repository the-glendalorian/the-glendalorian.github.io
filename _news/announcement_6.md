I presented my project, <a href="publications/">"AI vs Human Creativity: Investigating the Effectiveness of AI-Generated Advertisements"</a>, at the National Conference of Undergraduate Research 2025 Pittsburgh USA together with my partner Calvin Chan. A big thank you to my Marketing I (70-381) instructor Dr. Flora Feng for her guidance in this project.
