I presented my paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17288">"Stool Recognition for Colorectal Cancer Detection through Deep Learning"</a>, at the IEEE 4th International Conference on Computing and Machine Intelligence 2025 Michigan USA. I'm very grateful to my research mentor Dr. Bingquan Shen for his guidance in this research.
