I presented my paper, <a href="https://csitcp.org/paper/12/1211csit02.pdf">"Anti-Virus Autobots: Predicting More Infectious Virus Variants for Pandemic Prevention through Deep Learning"</a>, at the 4th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications 2022 Copenhagen Denmark. I'm very grateful to my research mentor Dr. Bingquan Shen for his guidance in this research!
