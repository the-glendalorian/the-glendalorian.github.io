I am joining the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/reliable-autonomous-systems-lab/">Reliable Autonomous Systems Lab</a>, led by <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/reid-simmons/">Prof. Reid Simmons</a>, at the CMU Robotics Institute! I will be developing a real-time system to track food items in a kitchen for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
