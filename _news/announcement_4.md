My contribution essay, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/gened/woven/issues/four/docs/piece-3-glenda-min.pdf">"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Art Restoration"</a>, has been published in WOVEN: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Dietrich College, Issue 4, Spring 2024. A big thank you to my Interpretation and Argument (76-101) instructor Dr. Chad Szalkowski-Ference for his guidance in this project!
