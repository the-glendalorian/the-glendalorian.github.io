Hello there! I'm a junior majoring in <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

To me, <a href="/publications">AI research</a> is extremely rewarding and I'm excited to solve real-world problems with AI.

Besides that, I love <a href="/projects/2_project.html">Star Wars</a> and playing my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theglendalorian">electric organ</a>.
