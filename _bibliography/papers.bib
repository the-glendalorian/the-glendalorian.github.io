  title={Vision and Tracking in a Smart AI Kitchen for Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment},
  author={Tan, Glenda and Han, Jessica and Ding, Ryan and Kondapalli, Pranavi},
  abstract={22% of adults in the United States aged 65 and over have mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Older adults with this condition often face challenges in everyday kitchen tasks, such as forgetting where they had previously placed food items. Hence, this research aims to develop an accurate, real-time and scalable system that tracks food items in a kitchen, and uses this data to help older adults with MCI search for their desired items. To build this system, live video streams from three Azure Kinect cameras were accessed to obtain real-time 3D information about the kitchen space. Next, potential food items in the frame were identified using zero-shot object detection models. Thereafter, the locations of these items would be determined based on the current detection data, human wrist data obtained from OpenPose and cabinet data obtained from the depth frame, and updated in a database. By accessing the database, the system would thus be able to help older adults search for their desired items. Therefore, this system can alleviate common challenges faced by older adults with MCI in the kitchen, giving them greater autonomy over their lives.},

  title={AI vs Human Creativity: Investigating the Effectiveness of AI-Generated Advertisements},
  author={Chan, Calvin and Tan, Glenda},
  abstract={With rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), many companies have begun incorporating generative AI into their advertising strategies, producing unique and engaging commercials that transcend the limits of traditional advertising. Given the immense success of these campaigns, this research aims to investigate if AI-generated ads can outperform their human-made counterparts in increasing consumer demand, and if so, the factors contributing to their greater success. To answer these questions, we first conducted two case analyses on Nike’s “Never Done Evolving” ft. Serena Williams campaign and Coca-Cola’s “Y3000” campaign. Next, we devised a theoretical framework of three potential success factors for AI-generated ads (complexity, creativity, and familiarity). Finally, a week-long field study was conducted on 240 Carnegie Mellon University students across different years and majors to study the effectiveness of AI-generated ads in increasing club membership of campus organizations, with club membership serving as a proxy for consumer demand. In this study, participants were randomly partitioned into four groups, with each group surveyed on how likely they were to join a club after viewing one of four posters (three AI-generated posters based on each factor of success and one human-made poster). Through this study, we discovered that although AI-generated posters are generally more effective than human-made posters in capturing people’s attention, their human-made counterparts are still more effective in increasing club membership. While AI-generated posters attract a larger audience, there is greater variation in the interest level of the audience. Future research can further explore the impact of AI advertisements on various aspects of marketing, such as click-thru rates and sales on different marketing platforms such as e-commerce.},

  title={Stool Recognition for Colorectal Cancer Detection through Deep Learning},
  author={Tan, Glenda and Goh, Karin and Shen, Bingquan},
  abstract={Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in Singapore and the third most common cancer worldwide. Blood in a person's stool is a symptom of this disease, and it is usually detected by the faecal occult blood test (FOBT). However, the FOBT presents several limitations - the collection process for the stool samples is tedious and unpleasant, the waiting period for results is about 2 weeks and costs are involved. In this research, we propose a simple-to-use, fast and cost-free alternative - a stool recognition neural network that determines if there is blood in one's stool (which indicates a possible risk of colorectal cancer) from an image of it. As this is a new classification task, there was limited data available, hindering classifier performance. Hence, various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (DiffAugment StyleGAN2, DCGAN, Conditional GAN) were trained to generate images of high fidelity to supplement the dataset. Subsequently, images generated by the GAN with the most realistic images (DiffAugment StyleGAN2) were concatenated to the classifier's training batch on-the-fly, improving accuracy to 94%. This model was then deployed to a mobile app - Poolice, where users can take a photo of their stool and obtain instantaneous results if there is blood in their stool, prompting those who do to seek medical advice. As "early detection saves lives", we hope our app built on our stool recognition neural network can help people detect colorectal cancer earlier, so they can seek treatment and have higher chances of survival.},

  title={The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Art Restoration},
  author={Tan, Glenda and Szalkowski-Ference, Chad},
  abstract={Art restoration, the practice of returning a damaged artwork to its original
condition, is challenging: each artwork requires a unique treatment and complex
ethical boundaries may be crossed. However, this field can be transformed by
today's artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which currently excel in artistic
tasks. Hence, this research aims to elucidate the role of AI in art restoration,
specifically in restoring damaged paintings. To achieve this, an AI image enhancer
web application was tested on images of three damaged paintings, with its digital
reconstructions benchmarked against the actual restorations using various
technical and aesthetic metrics. Results show that AI currently plays the role of an
assistant in the analysis stage of art restoration: while AI can propose feasible
intervention methods and produce digital reconstructions to aid art restorers in
restoration (accelerating, improving accuracy and lowering costs), it cannot guide
them in navigating complex ethical boundaries. Art restorers are still responsible
for striking the balance between improving an artwork's legibility and respecting
the original creation. These findings showcase the potential of AI to the artistic and
historical communities, spurring further research into developing more effective
AI algorithms.},

  abstract={In October 2023, a group of 44 scientists hailing from several U.S. states, Canada, Poland, and Switzerland came together for a hybrid in-person and virtual hackathon. The event was jointly hosted by Carnegie Mellon University Libraries and DNAnexus, a California-based cloud computing and bioinformatics company. This collaborative effort revolved around the theme of “Data Management and Graph Extraction for Large Transformer Models in the Biomedical Space.” In the spirit of fostering collaboration, participants organized themselves into five teams, which ultimately resulted in the successful completion of four hackathon projects. These projects encompassed a wide range of topics, from detecting features contributing to virus susceptibility to validating models using knowledge graphs. Repositories for the hackathon projects are available at https://github.com/collaborativebioinformatics. We hope that the insights and experiences shared by these teams, as detailed in the following manuscript, will prove valuable to the broader scientific community.},

  title={Predicting More Infectious Virus Variants for Pandemic Prevention through Deep Learning},
  author={Tan, Glenda and Koay, Tze Erhn and Shen, Bingquan},
  abstract={More infectious virus variants can arise from rapid mutations in their proteins, creating new infection waves. These variants can evade one's immune system and infect vaccinated individuals, lowering vaccine efficacy. Hence, to improve vaccine design, this project proposes Optimus PPIme - a deep learning approach to predict future, more infectious variants from an existing virus (exemplified by SARS-CoV-2). The approach comprises an algorithm which acts as a "virus" attacking a host cell. To increase infectivity, the "virus" mutates to bind better to the host's receptor. 2 algorithms were attempted - greedy search and beam search. The strength of this variant-host binding was then assessed by a transformer network we developed, with a high accuracy of 90%. With both components, beam search eventually proposed more infectious variants. Therefore, this approach can potentially enable researchers to develop vaccines that provide protection against future infectious variants before they emerge, pre-empting outbreaks and saving lives.},
